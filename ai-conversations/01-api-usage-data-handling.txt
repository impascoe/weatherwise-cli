Me: Is there a way to set the number of days when requesting a forecast?

AI: Yes, you can set the number of days for the weather forecast in wttr.in.

*For the Command-Line Client*
If you are using the Go-based CLI client (see internal/view/v1/cmd.go), you can specify the number of days with the `--days` option:
```sh
wttr --days 5
```
This will display a 5-day weather forecast.

*For the Web/API Interface*
For the web interface or API (the classic wttr.in usage), you can control the number of days by appending `?days=<n>` to your query. For example:
```
https://wttr.in/London?days=5
```
This will return a 5-day forecast for London.

*How it works in the code*
The parameter is processed by functions like `group_hours_to_days` and `create_standard_json_from_metno` in `lib/metno.py`, which use the `days_to_return` value to group and generate forecasts for the specified number of days.

*Summary:*
Set the number of days for the forecast by using the `days` parameter, either as a CLI flag (`--days`) or as a URL query parameter (`?days=`) when requesting a forecast from wttr.in.

Me: howw would you have multiple query params

AI: To use multiple query parameters in a URL (such as when querying the wttr.in API or most web APIs), you separate each parameter with an ampersand (`&`).

*Example:*
```
https://wttr.in/London?days=5&format=j1
```
In this example:
- `days=5` sets the forecast for 5 days.
- `format=j1` sets the output format to JSON version 1.

*General Syntax:*
```
<base_url>?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3
```

*Summary:*
Start with a question mark (`?`) for the first parameter, then use ampersands (`&`) between each additional parameter.

Me: how do i convert the resulting json response into a python dict

AI: You can convert a JSON response into a Python dict using the built-in `json` module. Here’s how you do it:

```python
import json

# Suppose you have a JSON response as a string (e.g., from requests.get(...).text)
json_response = '{"location": "London", "temperature": 15}'

# Convert JSON string to Python dict
data = json.loads(json_response)

print(data)
# Output: {'location': 'London', 'temperature': 15}
```

If you’re using the `requests` library and have a response object, you can get the dict directly:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://wttr.in/London?format=j1")
data = response.json()  # This is already a dict

print(data)
```

*Summary:*
- Use `json.loads(json_string)` if you have a JSON string.
- Use `response.json()` if you are using the `requests` library’s response object.

Me: It seems like setting the number of days does not do anything

AI: Here’s what I found based on the code and documentation in the wttr.in repository:

*1. The `days` Parameter in wttr.in*
  - *In CLI (wego-based):*
    The Go code accepts a `--days` (or `-days`) flag, and passes it as `num_of_days` to the backend weather API.
    Example:
    ```sh
    wttr --days 5
    ```
  - *In Web/API Requests:*
    The traditional web API (i.e., `curl wttr.in/London?days=5`) does not natively handle a `days` query parameter for arbitrary day counts.
    Instead, short single-digit options are parsed as part of the "short options" string (e.g., `?2` for two days), or handled by custom logic in the code.
    From the code:
    - `lib/parse_query.py` parses `?1`, `?2`, `?3` as short options and sets the `days` key in the internal query dictionary.
    - In `lib/view/wttr.py`, the number of lines of output is changed depending on `days` being 0, 1, or 2 (hardcoded output line counts). There is no flexible support for more than 2-3 days in this rendering.
    There is no evidence in the main web API code that a query like `?days=5` or `?days=7` produces a longer forecast.

*2. Alternative: "Data-rich" output (v2)*
  The README suggests using the experimental v2 output for more data, but does not mention arbitrary-day forecasts.

*3. Summary Table*
  | Interface          | Param/Option | Result                 |
  |--------------------|--------------|------------------------|
  | CLI (wego)         | `--days N`   | N days supported       |
  | Web/API (ANSI/html)| `?1, ?2, ?3` | 1-3 days, hardcoded    |
  | Web/API            | `?days=N`    | Not supported          |
  | v2 output          | N/A          | More data, not N days  |

*4. Why doesn't `days=` work?*
  - The front-end web handling in wttr.in only recognizes short single-digit options for days (e.g., `?2`), not arbitrary values.
  - The Go/CLI client passes `num_of_days` to the backend, but this is not exposed via the simple web interface.

*5. Source Code References*
  - `lib/parse_query.py`: Handles single-digit day options.
  - `lib/view/wttr.py`: Hardcodes output lines for 0, 1, 2 days.
  - `README.md`: No mention of arbitrary day support for the web.

*Conclusion:*
For web/API (curl) usage, only 1, 2, or 3-day forecasts are supported, and only via short options (`?1`, `?2`, etc.), not `?days=N`. The `days` parameter works as expected in the CLI client only.
If you want more days in the web output, you might need to request this as a feature or use the "v2" experimental format for richer data (but not longer forecasts).
